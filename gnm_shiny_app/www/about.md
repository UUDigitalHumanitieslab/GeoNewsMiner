#### About GeoNewsMiner (GNM)

GNM is an app that visualises references to place names in *ChroniclItaly* [(Viola 2018)](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/i-lab/UU01/T4YMOW.html), a corpus of ethnic historical newspapers previously tagged for entities using a sequence tagging tool [(Riedl and Padó 2018)](https://github.com/riedlma/sequence_tagging). GNM interactively displays such references as they have been geocoded, counted, and finally plotted on a world map. The full step-by-step documentation of the project is available on GitHub at this [link](https://github.com/lorellav/GeoNewsMiner).

In order to reflect the changing geo-political borders within the analysed period (1898-1920), users can additionally choose between three historical world maps displaying the different borders at three crucial points: 1880, 1914, 1920. By default, GNM displays a contemporary (1994) world map.

GNM has been created as an exploratory tool to assist researchers working in **spatial humanities**, a recently emerged interdisciplinary field within the digital humanities focused on geographic and conceptual space, especially from a historical perspective. Drawing from the application of Geographic Information Systems and data mining, GNM illustrates how the visualization of place names can provide researchers with new perspectives on the geographies of the past thus opening up new ways to study history. 

***ChroniclItaly***

GNM is based on _ChroniclItaly_ [(Viola 2018)](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/i-lab/UU01/T4YMOW.html), a corpus of Italian language newspapers published in the United States between 1898 and 1920. The corpus includes the front pages of seven Italian language newspapers published in California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia: _L’Italia_, _Cronaca
sovversiva_, _La libera parola_, _The patriot_, _La ragione_, _La rassegna_, and _La sentinella del
West Virginia_. The collection, which totals 4,810 issues and contains 16,624,571 words, is available as an open access resource at this [link](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/i-lab/UU01/T4YMOW.html). For further information on this resource, please check the **References** section under the **More** tab or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorellav/GeoNewsMiner). The tagged version of the collection [*ChroniclItaly 2.0*](https://doi.org/10.24416/UU01-4MECRO) is also available open acess.
