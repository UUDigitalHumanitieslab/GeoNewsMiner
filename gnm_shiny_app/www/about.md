#### About GeoNewsMiner (GNM)

GNM is an app that visualises references to place names in the Times Digital Archive (1945-1955), tagged for entities using [Spacy](https://spacy.io/). GNM interactively displays such references as they have been geocoded, counted, and finally plotted on a world map. The full step-by-step documentation of the original GeoNewsMiner project is available on GitHub at this [link](https://github.com/lorellav/GeoNewsMiner).

In order to reflect the changing geo-political borders within the analysed period (1898-1920), users can additionally choose between three historical world maps displaying the different borders at three crucial points: 1880, 1914, 1920. By default, GNM displays a contemporary (1994) world map.

GNM has been created as an exploratory tool to assist researchers working in **spatial humanities**, a recently emerged interdisciplinary field within the digital humanities focused on geographic and conceptual space, especially from a historical perspective. Drawing from the application of Geographic Information Systems and data mining, GNM illustrates how the visualization of place names can provide researchers with new perspectives on the geographies of the past thus opening up new ways to study history.
