This feature allows you to add regions to the map references based on low or high percentile frequency. For example, if you slide the bar to select only the range between 90 and 100, the map will display the 10 percent most frequently mentioned regions. Conversely, the range between 0 and 10 shows the 10 percent least mentioned regions. Please note that your selection does not affect the data displayed under the **Data** tab.
